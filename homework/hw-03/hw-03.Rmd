In this assignment you will work on data processing and data cleaning.

## Prerequisites

-   This assignment assumes that you have worked through all materials up to and including [week 5](https://ids2022.netlify.app/week05/) and [week 6](https://ids2022.netlify.app/week06/).
    Make sure you are familiar with this content.

## Workflow

Clone the homework template from [`https://github.com/uoeIDS/hw-03-template`](https://github.com/uoeIDS/hw-03-template) into your personal GitHub account. Remember to make your repository private and to add `uoeIDS` as a collaborator. Follow the initial instructions at the beginning of the previous homework assignment to set-up a version control R project.


## Packages

In this assignment we will use the following packages:

-   **tidyverse**: a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way

## Data collection 

```{r opensecrets, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.margin = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/opensecrets.png")
```

The data come from [OpenSecrets.org](https://www.opensecrets.org), a *"website tracking the influence of money on U.S. politics, and how that money affects policy and citizens' lives"*.
This website is hosted by The Center for Responsive Politics, which is a nonpartisan, independent non-profit that *"tracks money in U.S. politics and its effect on elections and public policy."*[^1]

Our goal is to merge the different data sets provided (11), to create a single dataset. Since that means repeating a task many times, you should write a function to create the data.

## Exercise 1

Write a function using a `for` loop in R to create a single data set and called it `pac_all` containing the contributions in all election years available. In your R Markdown file, load `pac_all.csv` and report its number of observations and variables as a full sentence.

üß∂‚úÖ‚¨ÜÔ∏è *If you haven't yet done so, now is definitely a good time to knit, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message (e.g. "Data merge complete"). Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*

## Data cleaning

In this section we clean the `pac_all` data frame to prepare it for analysis and visualization.
We have two goals in data cleaning:

-   Separate the `country_parent` into two such that country and parent company appear in different columns for country-level analysis.

-   Convert contribution amounts in `total`, `dems`, and `repubs` from character strings to numeric values.

The following exercises walk you through how to make these fixes to the data.

```{marginfigure}
__Note:__ If you cannot get the merge working, a `pac_all_backup.csv` already exists in your repository for you to work on.
```

```{marginfigure}
__Hint:__ Country and parent company names are separated by `/`, with some entries having two `/` (we want to split at the first `/`).
    This can be accomplished by setting the `extra` argument in `separate` to `"merge"` so that the cell is split into only 2 segments, e.g. `"Denmark/Novo Nordisk A/S"` into `"Denmark"` and `"Novo Nordisk A/S"`.
```

## Exercise 2

Use the `separate()` function to separate `country_parent` into `country` and `parent` columns. End your code chunk by printing out the top 10 rows of your data frame (if you just type the data frame name it should automatically do this for you).

```{marginfigure}
__Hint:__ The `$` character is a special character so it will need to be escaped. In addition, some contribution amounts are in the millions (e.g. Anheuser-Busch contributed a total of \$1,510,897 in 2008).
    In this case we need to remove all occurrences of `,`, which we can do by using `str_remove_all()` instead of `str_remove()`.
```

## Exercise 3

Remove the character strings including `$` and `,` signs in the `total`, `dems`, and `repubs` columns and convert these columns to numeric. End your code chunk by printing out the top 10 rows of your data frame (if you just type the data frame name it should automatically do this for you).

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è *Now is a good time to knit your document, and commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.*

## Data visualization and interpretation

```{marginfigure}
__Hint:__ You can calculate the sum of total contributions from PACs for each year for each country by using a sequence of `group_by()` then `summarise()`. You can make a plot of total contributions (y-axis) by year (x-axis) where two lines identified by different colours represent each of Canada and Mexico (similar to the plot in the next question).
```

## Exercise 4

Create a line plot of total contributions from all foreign-connected PACs in the Canada and Mexico over the years. Once you have made the plot, write a brief interpretation of what the graph reveals.

```{marginfigure}
__Hint:__ These are only UK contributions. You will need to make use of functions from the **scales** package for axis labels as well as from **ggplot2**.
```

In this exercise you get to be creative, try something new, and help your peers out!

# Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the prettiest of them all?

Here is a simple plot using the `mpg` dataset, which contains information on fuel economy of cars.
We are plotting highway miles per gallon vs. city miles per gallon, coloured by whether the car is front-wheel drive, rear wheel drive, or four-wheel drive. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, colour = drv)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 10) + 
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "green"),
        axis.line = element_line(size = rel(6), 
                                 arrow = arrow(), 
                                 colour = "black"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "red", 
                                        colour = "grey50"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = rel(2.0), 
                                    angle = 99),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = rel(.6), 
                                    angle = 40),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "green") )


```

```{marginfigure}
I realize that "pretty" is subjective, so we are mostly looking to see if you can figure out how to change the look of a plot using help files of functions you have not learned before.
```

## Exercise 5

Make this plot as pretty as possible by changing colours, background colour, fonts, or anything else you can think of. You will probably want to play around with [theme options](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html), but you can do more. You can also search online for other themes, fonts, etc. that you want to tweak. Try to make it as pretty as possible, the sky is the limit!


### Review your work

After answering each of the exercise, take a moment to review your work and to check that your code is clear and understandable. A proportion of the homework assignment marks are attributable to how you present your work, both code and written.

When reviewing your code, add new lines, tabs and spaces where appropriate to help aid the reader to understand what your code is doing. Even if the exercise does not explicitly ask you to write some text, it is also good practice to add a short sentence to be explicit about what is your answer to the question.


# Submission

Once you have answered all of the exercises, please make sure that you have knitted your document and committed all the changes to GitHub.

To submit your homework:

1.    Go to the Introduction to Data Science webpage on [LEARN](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/ultra/courses/_98726_1/cl/outline)
