Your task in this lab is to improve a plot that violates many data visualization best practices.
We want you to get creative and make a visualisation that tells a (much!) better story than the original plot.

# Learning goals

-   Telling a story with data.
-   Data visualization best practices.
-   Reshaping data.

::: {.home}
Complete the following steps during the workshop with your team.
:::

We will also be going through the steps of how you can working collaboratively in your teams in preparation for your projects. Please read the instructions carefully for who needs to do what and when, and ask a tutor for assistance if you are stuck.

# Warm up with your team

Take 5 minutes to go around the team, each pointing out one error in the following visual.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

Once you are done with this, give a number to each team member.
```{marginfigure}
If you want to assign numbers at random, you can go to the [Random.org sequence generator](https://www.random.org/sequences/?min=1&max=4&col=1&format=html&rnd=new), and assign the first number that appears to the person whose name is first in the alphabet, and so on.  Skip over any numbers that are larger than the size of your team.
```
In this lab, team members will take turns sharing their screen and working on an exercise in the common team repo, commit and push their changes, and then the next team member will take over and **pull** the changes before they make any further changes to their lab.
In the lab instructions you will see markers for

-   **EVERYONE** (for tasks everyone should do concurrently) or
-   **TEAM MEMBER X** (for tasks only team member X should do while sharing their screen and others contributing verbally but not typing anything).

# Getting started

## Repository

**TEAM MEMBER 1:**

-   You are the maintainer of the GitHub repository for today's lab worksheet.
-   Go to the course uoeIDS GitHub account and clone a copy of the Lab 02 template repository. As a reminder of the steps, go [HERE](https://github.com/uoeIDS/lab-02-template) and copy the HTTP URL from after clicking the green button. Add an informative name to the repository and press the green button to clone the repository.
-   In the repository you have just cloned, select 'setting' along the top and then 'Collaborators' in the sidebar. Add each of your team members as collaborators.


**TEAM MEMBERS 2+:**

-   You are all collaborators for today's lab worksheet.
-   Open your email and accept the email invitation to team member 1's GitHub repository.

**EVERYONE:**

-   Open RStudio and create a new version control project for the collaborative worksheet for today's lab. As a reminder:
  - Open RStudio and select _File_ > _New Project..._ > _Version Control_ > _Git_
  - Copy and paste the HTTP URL of the repository that team member 1 created.
  - Browse a suitable location to save your local copy, and select _Create Project_


## Adding your name

**Important**: For the next few steps, only one person at a time should be doing the following steps. Everyone else should take their hands off their computer and do not jump ahead! If you come across a problem (specifically a merger conflict) then raise your hand for a tutor to help.


**TEAM MEMBER 1:**

-   Hands on the computer! 
-   Click the _Pull_ button in the Git pane (top-right) to download the latest updates to the repository. You should anticipate that there has been no changes as you are the first person.
-   Open the _lab-02-sad-plot.Rmd_ R Markdown template file.
-   At the top, replace the author text _User1_ with your name.
-   Save the file and knit the document. Your name (and only your name) should appear at the top of the html file.
-   Go to the _Git_ pane to _stage_ and _commit_ the changes you have made with an informative message (e.g. "Add name of user 1").
-   _Push_ the changes to GitHub.
-   Hands off the computer!

**TEAM MEMBER 2:**

-   Hands on the computer! 
-   Click _Pull_ in the Git pane to download the latest updates to the repository.
-   Open the _lab-02-sad-plot.Rmd_ R Markdown template file. You should notice that team member 1 has written their name.
-   Replace the author text _User2_ with your name. 
-   Save and knit the document.
-   Go to the _Git_ pane to _stage_ and _commit_ the changes you have made with an informative message (e.g. "Add name of user 2").
-   _Push_ the changes to GitHub.
-   Hands off the computer!

**OTHER TEAM MEMBERS:**

-   In turn, follow the steps above to _Pull_ the latest version, add your name to the author, _stage_ and _commit_ with an informative message, and finally _Push_ all changes to the GitHub repository.

**EVERYONE:**

-   Hands on the computer and _Pull_ the most recent version of the repository with everyone's names.

## Working collaboratively!

Congratulations, you have now started working collaboratively from the same repository in GitHub. This will be extremely useful in your projects for sharing out the workload amongst team members.

GitHub is very smart when merging the repository in GitHub with the updated version you _Push_ from RStudio. Typically, each team member works in different locations in the repository and there should not be any major merger issues. However, each team member in the above instructions are changing the same line in the R Markdown document and so it was important for only one member does their task at any one time. Otherwise you would have created a _Merger Conflict_ (ask a tutor for help if this happens to your team). We will discuss how to resolve merger conflicts in the next lab.



## Packages

**EVERYONE:** Before getting started with the Exercises, run the following code in the Console to load this package.

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data: Instructional staff employment trends

The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is a non-profit membership association of faculty and other academic professionals.
[This report](https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP_Report_InstrStaff-75-11_apr2013.pdf) compiled by the AAUP shows trends in instructional staff employees between 1975 and 2011, and contains an image very similar to the one given below.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/staff-employment.png")
```

**EVERYONE:** Let's start by loading the data used to create this plot.

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```

Each row in this dataset represents a faculty type, and the columns are the years for which we have data.
The values are percentage of hires of that type of faculty for each year.

```{r echo=FALSE}
staff
```

In order to recreate this visualization we first need to reshape the data to have one variable for faculty type and one variable for year.
In other words, we will convert the data from the long format to wide format.

# Exercises

**TEAM MEMBER 1 should write the answer to Exercises 1, and then commit and push their changes. Everyone else: participate, help out, but no typing in the R Markdown document and no committing/pushing!**

1.  If the long data will have a row for each year/faculty type combination, and there are 5 faculty types and 11 years of data, how many rows will the data have? Discuss as a team and write down your answer.

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **At this point TEAM MEMBER 1 should knit the Rmd, stage, commit, and push their changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TEAM MEMBER 2 should now pull ‚¨áÔ∏è before doing anything else. They should then write the answers to Exercises 2 and 3, and then commit and push their changes. Everyone else: participate, help out, but no typing in the R Markdown document and no committing/pushing!**

We do the wide to long conversation using `pivot_longer()`.
The animation below show how this function works, as well as its counterpart `pivot_wider()`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidyr-longer-wider.gif")
```

Quick reminder: the function has the following arguments:

```{r eval=FALSE}
pivot_longer(data, cols, names_to = "name")
```

-   The first argument is `data` as usual.
-   The second argument, `cols`, specifies the columns to pivot into longer format.
-   The third argument, `names_to`, is the name of the column where column names of pivoted variables go (character string).
-   The fourth argument, `values_to` is the name of the column where data in pivoted variables go (character string).

2.  Fill in the blanks in the following code chunk to pivot the staff data longer and save it as a new data frame called `staff_long`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
staff_long <- ___ %>%
  ___(
    cols = ___, 
    names_to = "___",
    values_to = "___"
    )
```

3.  Inspect `staff_long` to check if your guess regarding number of rows from Exercise 1 was correct.

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **At this point TEAM MEMBER 2 should knit the Rmd, commit, and push their changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TEAM MEMBER 3 should now pull ‚¨áÔ∏è before doing anything else. They should then write the answers to Exercises 4 and 5, and then commit and push their changes. Everyone else: participate, help out, but no typing in the R Markdown document and no committing/pushing!**

4.  We will plot instructional staff employment trends as a line plot. A possible approach for creating a line plot where we colour the lines by faculty type is the following, but it does not quite look right. What is wrong with the graph?  (You do not need to say how to fix it here---that is the next question!)

```{r eval=FALSE}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line()
```

5.  Next, add a `group` aesthetic to the plot (grouping by `faculty_type`) and plot again. What does the plot reveal about instructional staff employment trends over the years?

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **At this point TEAM MEMBER 3 should knit the Rmd, commit, and push their changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TEAM MEMBER 4 should now pull ‚¨áÔ∏è before doing anything else. They should then write the answers to Exercise 6, and then commit and push their changes. Everyone else: participate, help out, but no typing in the R Markdown document and no committing/pushing! (If your team has fewer than 4 people, just move back to the first member.)**
```{marginfigure}
If there is no TEAM MEMBER 4 then cycle back round to TEAM MEMEBER 1.
```

6.  Improve the line plot from the previous exercise by fixing up its labels (title, axis labels, and legend label) as well as any other components you think could benefit from improvement.

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **At this point TEAM MEMBER 4 should knit the Rmd, commit, and push their changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The next team member should now pull ‚¨áÔ∏è before doing anything else. They should then write the answers to Exercise 7 and 8, and then commit and push their changes. Everyone else: participate, help out, but no typing in the R Markdown document and no committing/pushing!**
```{marginfigure}
If someone in your team is participating remotely, remember to share screens.
```

7.  Suppose the objective of this plot was to show that the proportion of part-time faculty have gone up over time compared to other instructional staff types. What changes would you propose making to this plot to tell this story? Write down your idea(s). The more precise you are, the easier the next step will be. Get creative, and think about how you can modify the dataset to give you new/different variables to work with.
8.  Implement at least one of these ideas you came up with in the previous exercise. You should produce an improved data visualisation and accompany your visualisation with a brief paragraph describing the choices you made in your improvement, specifically discussing what you didn't like in the original plot and why, and how you addressed them in the visualisation you created.

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **At this point the team member should knit the Rmd, commit, and push their changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.**

# Wrapping up

Go back through your write up to make sure you are following coding style guidelines we discussed in class.
Make any edits as needed.

Also, make sure all of your R chunks are properly labelled and your figures are reasonably sized.

Once the last person pushes their final changes, others should pull the changes and knit the R Markdown document to confirm that they can reproduce the report.

## Making and managing personal copies

**TEAM MEMBERS 1:**
After today's lab, you may want to prevent others from making any further changes to the worksheet.
-   First ensure that your team members have pulled the latest version of the repository.
-   In the lab worksheet repository on GitHub, go to _Settings_ and then _Collaborators_.
-   Remove your team members so that they can no longer push changes to the repository.

**TEAM MEMBERS 2+:** 
Take a personal clone of today's lab worksheet from team member 1. Go to your GitHub repository and when creating a new repository select "Import a repository". In the text box, paste the HTTPS URL of today's lab repository by team member 1. Note that when team member 1 removes you as a collaborator from their GitHub repository then you will lose the permission to push any further changes. In that case, you may need to create a new R project that connects to your personal GitHub repository.
