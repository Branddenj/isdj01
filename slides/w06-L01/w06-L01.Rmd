# R environment

---

## üèÅ Start with `sessionInfo()`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="110%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/sessioninfo.png")
```

---

## For more information
Use `search` to get the list of all the attached packages in the R search path.

```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="75%"}
search()
library(evd)
search()
```


---

Use `ls()` to see all the variables and functions that are defined in the current working directory in R. It returns a vector of character strings.

```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="85%"}
ls()
```
If I add a variable or a function to the global environment.
```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="85%"}
a<-1; b<-10
f<-function(x) x<-1
ls()
```
Remove a variable or function from the global environment.
```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="85%"}
rm(a,f)
ls()
```

---

Use `ls()` to see what is defined in a specific package.

```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="65%"}
search()
```
Let's see what is in package `datasets` of the list.
```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="65%"}
ls(18)
```

---
Use `ls()` to list all the objects in a package.
```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="65%"}
ls("package:datasets")
```

# Functions

---

## When should you write a function?

--
.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/funct-all-things.png")
```
]
--
.pull-right[
When you‚Äôve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice.
]

---
## Why functions?

- Automate common tasks in a more powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting:
  - Give your function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand
  - As requirements change, only need to update code in one place, instead of many
  - Eliminate chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another)

--

- Down the line: Improve your reach as a data scientist by writing functions (and packages!) that others use


## Turn your code into a function

- Pick a short but informative **name**, preferably a verb.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

```{r eval=FALSE}
name_function <- 
  
  
  
```

---

## Turn your code into a function

- Pick a short but evocative **name**, preferably a verb.
- List inputs, or **arguments**, to the function inside `function`. If we had more the call would look like `function(x, y, z)`.

<br>

```{r eval=FALSE}
name_function <- function(x){
  
  
  
}  
```

---

## Turn your code into a function

- Pick a short but informative **name**, preferably a verb.
- List inputs, or **arguments**, to the function inside `function`. If we had more the call would look like `function(x, y, z)`.
- Place the **code** you have developed in body of the function, a `{` block that immediately follows `function(...)`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
name_function  <- function(x){

  # code you want the function to do
  # if different outputs add the specific return()
  
}
```

# Writing functions

---

## What goes in / what comes out?

.pull-left-wide[
- They take input(s) defined in the function definition

```{r eval=FALSE}
function([inputs separated by commas]){
  # what to do with those inputs
}
```

- By default they return the last value computed in the function

```{r eval=FALSE}
name_function <- function(x){
  # do bunch of stuff with the input...
  
  # return the final object
  return(...)
}
```

- You can define more outputs to be returned in a list as well as nice print methods (but we won't go there for now...)
]

.question[
What is going on here?
]

```{r}
add_2 <- function(x){
  x + 2
  1000
}
```

```{r}
add_2(3)
add_2(10)
```

## Naming functions

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton

---

## Naming functions

- Names should be short but clearly evoke what the function does

--
- Names should be verbs, not nouns

--
- Multi-word names should be separated by underscores (`snake_case` as opposed to `snakeCase`)

--
- A family of functions should be named similarly (`scrape_page()`, `scrape_speech()` OR `str_remove()`, `str_replace()` etc.)

---
## Overwriting existing functions

```{r}
mean
mean(1:10)
```
What happened if we write a function with the same name?
```{r}
mean<-function(x){x+2}
mean(1:10)
```
---
Now `mean` is the new function.
```{r}
mean
```
To use the later version you can:
```{r}
base::mean(1:10)
```
--
- Avoid overwriting existing (especially widely used) functions

```{r eval=FALSE}
# JUST DON'T
mean <- function(x){ 
  x+2
  }
```
```{r}
rm(mean)
```
---

## Function in action

Create a function that calculates the area of a circle.

1 The function need as input the `radius` of the circle.

2 The function should return the area of the circle.
```{r}
area<-function(r) { pi*r^2 }
area(2)
```
If the radius is negative?
```{r}
area(-2)
```
**Be careful!**
---
Add a condition, if the input is negative, the function should return an error.

* `message`  prints a message but not stop execution.

* `warning`  prints a warning message but not stop execution.

* `stop`  stops execution of the current expression and executes an error action.
```{r}
area<-function(r) {
  if (r<0)
    message("Error, provide positive radius.")
  else  pi*r^2 }
area(2)
```
If the radius is negative?
```{r}
area(-2)
```
---

## R operators

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/operators.png")
```

---

## R operators example
Logical And `&` vectorized version. It compares two vectors element-wise and returns a vector of
TRUE and/or FALSE.
```{r echo=TRUE, out.width="55%"}
x<-0:2
y<-2:0
(x<1) & (y>1)
```
Logical And `&&` unvectorized version. It compares only the first value in each vector, left to right,
and returns only the first logical result.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
x<-0:2
y<-2:0
(x<1) && (y>1)
```

---

## R operators example
Logical Or `|` vectorized version. It compares two vectors element-wise and returns a vector of
TRUE and/or FALSE.
```{r echo=TRUE, out.width="55%"}
x<-0:2
y<-2:0
(x<1) | (y>1)
```
Logical Or `||` unvectorized version. It compares only the first value in each vector, left to right,
and returns only the first logical result.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
x<-0:2
y<-2:0
(x<1) || (y>1)
```

---

Remember the function **area**.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
area<-function(r) {
  if (r<0)
   message("Error, provide positive radius.")
  else  pi*r^2 }
```
Evaluate in a character or a logic value.
```{r}
area(TRUE)
```
`TRUE` logical is taken as `1`. Add the condition that `radius` should be a numeric value.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
area<-function(r) {
  if (r<0 | !is.numeric(r) )
      return("Error, provide positive numeric radius.")
  else  pi*r^2 }
```
Try again.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
area(TRUE)
```

# Loops in R

---
## For loops in R
`for (values) {expression}`

The `for` loop will iterate the expression through the number of components in `values` (list, matrix or vector) one at a time.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
for (i in 1:10){
  print(5*i)
}
```
---

## While loops in R
`while (values) {expression}`

The `while` loop will iterate the expression as long as the component in `values` is TRUE.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
i<-0
while (i<10){
  print(5*i)
  i<-i+1  #Be careful or is an infinite loop
}
```
---

## Avoiding Explicit Loops 
Example: I have 1000 observations of each variable x, y and z. 
```{r,echo=TRUE}
x<-0:1000
y<-1000:2000
z<-3000:4000
```
I want the mean of each observation. 
```{r,echo=TRUE}
m1<-mean(c(x[1],y[1],z[1])); m1
m2<-mean(c(x[2],y[2],z[2])); m2 #Repeat 1000 times (length(x))
```
---
## Write a loop
```{r,echo=TRUE}
m<-numeric() #Define an empty variable to save the results.

for (i in 1:length(x)){
  aux <- mean(c(x[i],y[i],z[i]))
  m <- c(m,aux)
}
m[1:100]
```
---
* Apply function family includes: `apply, sapply, lapply and tapply`.
*Useful data manipulation: `cbind, rbind`.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
data<-cbind(x,y,z) #Add as column 
head(data)
m<-apply(data,1,mean) #apply function mean to each 1--columns, 2--rows.
m[1:50]
```
---
Compare times of two approaches for 1,000 observations.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
start.time <- Sys.time()
m<-numeric() #Define an empty variable to save the results.
for (i in 1:length(x)){
  aux <- mean(c(x[i],y[i],z[i]))
  m <- c(m,aux)
}
end.time <- Sys.time()
end.time - start.time
```
```{r,echo=TRUE}
start.time <- Sys.time()
data<-cbind(x,y,z) #Add as column 
m<-apply(data,1,mean)
end.time <- Sys.time()
end.time - start.time
```
---
Compare times of two approaches for 10,000 observations.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
x<-0:10000; y<-10000:20000; z<-30000:40000
start.time <- Sys.time()
m<-numeric() #Define an empty variable to save the results.
for (i in 1:length(x)){
  aux <- mean(c(x[i],y[i],z[i]))
  m <- c(m,aux)
}
end.time <- Sys.time()
end.time - start.time
```
```{r,echo=TRUE}
start.time <- Sys.time()
data<-cbind(x,y,z) #Add as column 
m<-apply(data,1,mean)
end.time <- Sys.time()
end.time - start.time
```
