# R environment

---

## üèÅ Start with `sessionInfo()`

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="110%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/sessioninfo.png")
```

---

## For more information
Use `search` to get the list of all the attached packages in the R search path.

.pull-left[
```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="75%", R.options=list(width = 60)}
search()

```
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="75%", R.options=list(width = 60)}
library(evd)
search() 
```
]

---
Use `ls()` to see all the variables and functions that are defined in the current working directory in R. It returns a vector of character strings. 
```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="85%"}
ls()
```
If I add a variable or a function to the global environment. 
```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="85%"}
a <- 1
b <- 10
f <- function(x) x <- 1
ls()
```
Remove a variable or function from the global environment.
```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="85%"}
rm(a, f)
ls()
```

---

Use `ls()` to see what is defined in a specific package.

```{r echo=TRUE,out.width="65%"}
search()
```
Let's see what is in package `datasets` of the list.
```{r echo=TRUE,out.width=20,R.options=list(max.print = 15)}
ls(18)
```

---
Use `ls()` to list all the objects in a package.
```{r echo=TRUE, out.width="65%", R.options=list(max.print = 45)}
ls("package:datasets")
```

# Functions

## When should you write a function?

--
.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/funct-all-things.png")
```
]
--
.pull-right[
When you‚Äôve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice.
]

---
## Why functions?

- Automate common tasks in a more powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting:
  - Give your function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand
  - As requirements change, only need to update code in one place, instead of many
  - Eliminate chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another)

--

- Down the line: Improve your reach as a data scientist by writing functions (and packages!) that others use


## Turn your code into a function

- Pick a short but informative **name**, preferably a verb.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

```{r eval=FALSE}
name_function <- 
  
  
  
```

---

## Turn your code into a function

- Pick a short but informative **name**, preferably a verb.
- List inputs, or **arguments**, to the function inside `function`. If we had more the call would look like `function(x, y, z)`.

<br>

```{r eval=FALSE}
name_function <- function(x){
  
  
  
}  
```

## Turn your code into a function

- Pick a short but informative **name**, preferably a verb.
- List inputs, or **arguments**, to the function inside `function`. If we had more the call would look like `function(x, y, z)`.
- Place the **code** you have developed in body of the function, a `{` block that immediately follows `function(...)`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
name_function  <- function(x){

  # code you want the function to do
  # if different outputs add the specific return()
  
}
```

# Writing functions

## What goes in / what comes out?

.pull-left-wide[
- They take input(s) defined in the function definition

```{r eval=FALSE}
function([inputs separated by commas]){
  # what to do with those inputs
}
```

- By default they return the last value computed in the function

```{r eval=FALSE}
name_function <- function(x){
  # do bunch of stuff with the input...
  
  # return the final object
  return(...)
}
```

- You can define more outputs to be returned in a list as well as nice print methods (but we won't go there for now...)

.question[
What is going on here?

```{r}
add_2 <- function(x){
  x + 2
  1000
}
```

```{r}
add_2(3)
add_2(10)
```

## Naming functions

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton

---

## Naming functions

- Names should be short but clearly evoke what the function does

--
- Names should be verbs, not nouns

--
- Multi-word names should be separated by underscores (`snake_case` as opposed to `snakeCase`)

--
- A family of functions should be named similarly (`scrape_page()`, `scrape_speech()` OR `str_remove()`, `str_replace()` etc.)

---
## Overwriting existing functions

```{r}
mean
mean(1:10)
```
What happened if we write a function with the same name?
```{r}
mean <- function(x){ x+2 }
mean(1:10)
```
---
Now `mean` is the new function.
```{r}
mean
```
To use the later version you can:
```{r}
base::mean(1:10)
```
--
- Avoid overwriting existing (especially widely used) functions

```{r eval=FALSE}
# JUST DON'T
mean <- function(x){ 
  x+2
  }
```
```{r}
rm(mean)
```
---

## Function in action

Create a function that calculates the area of a circle.

1. The function need as input the `radius` of the circle.

2. The function should return the area of the circle.
```{r}
area <- function(r) { pi*r^2 }
area(2)
```
If the radius is negative?
```{r}
area(-2)
```
**Be careful!**
---
Add a condition, if the input is negative, the function should return an error.

* `message`  prints a message but not stop execution.

* `warning`  prints a warning message but not stop execution.

* `stop`  stops execution of the current expression and executes an error action.
```{r}
area <- function(r) {
  if (r < 0) stop("Error, provide positive radius.")
  return(pi*r^2)
}
area(2)
```
If the radius is negative?
```{r eval=FALSE}
area(-2)  ## Produce error message
```
---

Remember the function **area**.
```{r,echo=FALSE}
area <- function(r) {
  if (r < 0) stop("Error, provide positive radius.")
  return(pi*r^2)
}
```
Evaluate in a character or a logic value.
```{r}
area(TRUE)
```
`TRUE` logical is taken as `1`. Add the condition that `radius` should be a numeric value.
```{r,echo=TRUE}
area <- function(r) {
  if (r < 0 | !is.numeric(r) )
      stop("Error, provide positive numeric radius.")
  return(pi*r^2)
  }
```
Try again.
```{r,eval = FALSE}
area(TRUE)  ## now creates an error msg
```
